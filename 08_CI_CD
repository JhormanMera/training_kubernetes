#CI/CD (Continuos integration - Continuos Delivery/deployment) 

So today we will create our first pipelines for CI process.

We have to keep in mind that we are working on a local environment so we dont have a PUBLIC URL in order to connect jenkins with github via webhook. 

To solve this problem we have many alternatives like:
- Make a DNS forwarding to our router using tools such as DuckDNS and NO-Ip
- Buy a public IP (Good luck)
- Use ngrok
- Use serveo

For this guide we'll use serveo because is easier and simplest than the other options. 

## Prerequisites
- A Jenkins server running
- Github repository

## Steps

1. Open terminal and paste command: ssh -R 80:<localhost_with_jenkins_port_number> serveo.net
2.
